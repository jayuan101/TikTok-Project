# TikTok-Project

In build a logistic regression model in Python. As you have learned, logistic regression helps you estimate the probability of an outcome. For data science professionals, this is a useful skill because it allows you to consider more than one variable against the variable you're measuring against. This opens the door for much more thorough and flexible analysis to be completed.


The purpose of this project is to demostrate knowledge of EDA and regression models.

The goal is to build a logistic regression model and evaluate the model.
This activity has three parts:

Part 1: EDA & Checking Model Assumptions

What are some purposes of EDA before constructing a logistic regression model?
Part 2: Model Building and Evaluation

Part 3: Interpreting Model Results
